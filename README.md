# Fireman

**Fireman** is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to create, edit and run PHP-Laravel applications. _Fireman_ is designed to be a competitor to [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/).

## Features
- [x] **User Authentication**: Ability to create and login into accounts.

- [x] **Project Creation**: Starts a sandboxed environment and links to the user. (Still, other than this no functionality is present.)

- [x] **Preview**: To allowing viewing of the website.

- [ ] **AI-Driven Code Generation**: Generate Laravel projects (controllers, models, views, migrations) from natural language prompts. 

- [ ] **Browser Based IDE**: To enable edits to codebase from browser with real-time updates. 

> **Cost-Effectiveness**: We are trying to keep the costs as minimal as possible while providing quality to the users using the platform.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Project Management CRUD, (main focus, creation and deletion)
