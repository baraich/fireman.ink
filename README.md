## Features
- [ ] **AI-Driven Code Generation**: Generate Laravel projects (controllers, models, views, migrations) from natural language prompts. 

- [ ] **Browser Based IDE**: To enable edits to codebase from browser with real-time updates. 

- [ ] **Previews**: _self-explanatory_

> **Cost-Effectiveness**: We are trying to keep the costs as minimal as possible while providing quality to the users using the platform.

## Roadmap
